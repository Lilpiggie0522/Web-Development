# Making an object

# Note that a function within an object is called a method!
# Expression is something that produces a value such as 1+3 or return

**var*user*={
    *name*:*"String"*,
    *age*:34,
    *hobby*,
    *isMarried*:*false*
}**

# Access elements within objects
**user.name**
**user.isMarried**
etc

# Adding or changing properties to the object
**user.favouriteFood="spinach"**

**user.isMarried = true;**

# Note that an object can have an array within and an array can also have an object within.

# Null Object is completely empty, cannot call any method with it!
