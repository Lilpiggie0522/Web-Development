# 121 Data structures

# Arrays

**var *list of animals* = ["tiger", "cat", "bear"]**

## Arrays can have whole bunch of different data types in one array such as strings, functions, numbers and booleans and undefined all together in one array. This is not advised though!

## We can have an array within an array

# Methods that arrays have
***list*.shift()** This removes the element that is at the very front of the array.

***list*.pop()** This remove the element that is at the very end of the array. **Note that this will modify the original list**

***list*.push()** This adds an element at the very end of the array.
**Note that this will modify the original list**

***list*.concat(["",""])** This concatenate another array to the list.
**This method will not modify the original list unless reassign variable**

***list*.sort()** This sorts the array in alphabetical order.

***list*.reverse()**
